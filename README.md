# BIGG-metabolicmaps

- using julia, linear programming, struct and vector graphics to make escher metabolic maps. 
- thanks to [cormullion](https://github.com/cormullion) for having a proper scientific result approaching discussion. 
- to do: add the final changes and add the example file. 
```
suppose you have a reaction of a metabolite like this: http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iJO1366/reactions/PRASCSi
then the csv file to this vectorgraphic should be:
start, end
asp__L_c,h_c
atp_c,adp_c
asp__L,pi_c
and your startreaction and end reaction will be ``` 5aizc_c, 25aics_c```
```
